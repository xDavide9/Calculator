- Lots of operation ranging from simple to complex ones
- Built with JavaFX using fxml and the Scene Builder

### User Guide

Input a _number_ -> press `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` -> the number now vanishes -> input another _number_ -> either press [`=`] to display the result or continue to chain operations

<hr>

Press `FN` ->  switch from simple to more complex functions and vice versa
