### User Guide

Input a _number_ -> press `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` -> the number now vanishes -> input another _number_ -> either press [`=`] to display the result or continue to chain operations.

<hr>

Press `FN` -> more functions that either modify the number on screen or need another number as input to finish the operation
